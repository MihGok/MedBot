I feel a constant dull ache in my lower back that radiates to the right buttock and down the back of my thigh, making every movement feel like a struggle as if my spine might give way at any moment; the weight of it presses on me all day long, reminding me that rest does not truly bring relief, and I find myself constantly shifting positions to chase away the discomfort that never fully leaves me.
This morning I woke up with a stiff locked feeling in my neck and a sharp, burning irritation in my throat each time I tried to swallow, as though every swallow scraped my esophagus with invisible sandpaper; the dryness feels endless, and my voice cracked and hoarse before I even finished my first cup of coffee, leaving me hesitant to speak or laugh for fear of worsening the sensation.
Lately I have been experiencing intermittent fevers spiking around 100–102 °F, accompanied by a heavy constriction in my chest that makes each breath feel like I’m inhaling through a narrow straw; these episodes come and go without warning, and afterward I’m left weak and trembling, as though my body has been wrung out and lacks the energy to recover fully before the next attack strikes.
I have noticed red, swollen patches on my forearms and neck that pulse with a prickly itch, especially under dim light; at times they feel as if they’re crawling with tiny pins, and the constant urge to scratch leaves me restless at night, turning over sheets and pillows in search of relief that never truly comes.
My heart races unexpectedly even when I’m sitting still, the pounding echoing in my ears like a relentless drumbeat; on some days the rhythm jumps and stutters, sending waves of anxiety through me, and I spend hours wondering whether I’ll feel normal again or if every quiet moment will be punctuated by this unsettling percussion.
Climbing the stairs in my house triggers a sharp pressure behind my kneecaps and little pops inside that startle me, making me pause and grip the railing for support; afterward I sit for long minutes feeling unsure if I can trust my legs to carry me any further, the memory of each pop echoing in my mind like a warning.
My body feels weighed down by unrelenting fatigue that sleep barely touches, as though I’m moving through molasses whenever I try to walk or lift my arms; even simple tasks like opening a door or typing a message become monumental efforts, and I spend more time resting in chairs than actually living my days.
I have episodic head throbbing around my temples and forehead, accompanied by waves of nausea and a sensitivity to light so intense that even the glow of my phone screen makes me wince; these episodes can last for hours, forcing me to retreat to a dark room in silence while I wait for the world to stop spinning and the pounding to subside.
In the evening I experience trembling weakness in my hands whenever I try to lift anything heavier than a cup, as though the muscles have turned to jelly; my fingers shake so badly that I spill my drink more often than not, and I find myself avoiding dinner with friends for fear of the embarrassment it brings.
I’m plagued by persistent heartburn after eating, a fiery heat that rises through my chest and into my throat, leaving a sour, bitter taste lingering in my mouth; this sensation follows me from breakfast to bedtime, making me dread every meal yet never truly relieving itself, no matter how long I sit upright or sip water in small, cautious gulps.
